# SMS/MMS Integration Application

This application is designed to consume API services from the TelAPI compatible services such as Twilio, Avaya CPaaS, Bandwidth and others.  This service will then either push messages to Avaya Workplace users via Avaya Spaces OR allow users to pick up messages via a built-in chat repository.

Built using the Lucee Java runtime and designed to be deployed via containers.  Requires a database server of somekind (MySQL, MariaDB, Postgres, etc.)
